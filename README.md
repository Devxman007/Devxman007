\*\*A I am a frontend developer passionate about web technologies (web design, HTML, CSS, JS, etc.) and other frameworks especially React JS. My experiences include working as a freelancer JavaScript developer for a while at multiple platforms as well as an employee for couple of years as a web developer Currently, I am enrolled in Udacity's React Nanodegree program where I am learning more about React libraries (React Native, Redux, etc.), new ECMAScript standards and other stuff. Moving forward, I want to enrich my skills and live up to other challenges to increase my experience in web front development.
