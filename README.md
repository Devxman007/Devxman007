My experiences include working as a freelancer JavaScript developer for a while at multiple platforms as well as an employee for couple of years as a web developer Currently, I am enrolled in Udacity's React Nanodegree program where I am learning more about React libraries (React Native, Redux, etc.), new ECMAScript standards and other stuff.
